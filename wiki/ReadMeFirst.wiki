1) Embedded System (AE):

   Running on Ubuntu 12.04, consists of a main daemon, which communicates
   with 1 or more monitors.  This communication is via stdin/stdout.  The
   daemon will 'load' the monitors (via exec??)
  
   The current monitors supported are:

    -- self monitor
    -- socket monitor
    -- file 
    -- critical file monitor (tbd)
