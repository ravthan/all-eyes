=1) Embedded System (AE):=

   Running on Ubuntu 12.04, consists of a main daemon, which communicates
   with 1 or more monitors.  This communication is via stdin/stdout.  The
   daemon will 'load' the monitors (via exec??)
  
   The current monitors supported are:

    o self monitor
    o socket monitor
    o file 
    o critical file monitor (tbd) 

    Protocol between daemon & monitors is described here:

= Development Environments:=

  a) AE:

     Utilizes google svn, located at:

         https://code.google.com/p/all-eyes/source/browse/

     Users may use CLI/command line access for their developers
