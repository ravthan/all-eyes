#summary Bug Bounty Program

= Introduction =

The TBRT team is introducing a Bug Bounty Program, to allow other students within the Applications Security class to earn points by finding security related bugs within the all-eyes project/product.

= Details =

    #  There are a total of 10 points being offered.
    #  The points will be provided to the first 10 valid reports of a security issue, that is not already documented. Please see:
     https://code.google.com/p/all-eyes/issues/list
    #  The most points one individual can obtain is *2*.
    #  Please send a separate email to *_tbrt.bug@gmail.com_*, documenting the specific issue.  Include in the email your name and student id.  Also, submit the bug via the issues page(Note: You will  need to create a google user account, if do not already have one):
     http://code.google.com/p/all-eyes/issues/list
    #  The report could be either:
       ## Showing an actual issue while running the all-eyes product.
       ## Finding a issue during code-review.  For this case, please include an example program (both src & executable) with details on the issue, and also how to run the example program to the problem.
    #  The deadline is Sunday December 2nd, 2pm PST.
    #  After the deadline, we will send a list to Professor Cappos.
