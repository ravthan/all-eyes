#summary Bug Bounty Program

= Introduction =

The TBRT team is introducing a Bug Bounty Program, to allow other students within the Applications Security class to earn points by finding security related bugs within the all-eyes project/product.

= Details =

    #  There are a total of 10 points being offered
    #  The points will be provided to the first 10 valid reports of a security issue.
    #  The most one individual can obtain is *3*.
    #  Please send a separate email to *_heyyoulive@gmail.com_*, documenting the specific issue.   
    #  The report could be either:
       ## Showing an actual problem while running the all-eyes product.
       ## Finding a problem during code-review.  For this case, please include an example program (both src & executable) with details on the issue, and also how to run the example program to show the problem.

Thank you, please send any questions to *_heyyoulive@gmail.com_*
