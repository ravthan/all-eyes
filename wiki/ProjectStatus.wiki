= Goals =
Perfect security is a myth. Most unbreakable security of today, ages to vulnerability over time. Hence taking quick action after a security breach is critical. Having a security layer along defensive lines, i.e. doing passive/active monitoring of critical components and taking actions based on configurable thresholds provides such a mitigation, against a possible security breach. All-Eyes is such a framework with a potpourri of tools (monitors) useful for defenders, attackers and security professionals.

The goal of All-Eyes project is to ensure the scalability from small embedded systems to large scale servers.

For the NYU-POLY Application Security class project, we prototyped the concept on Ubuntu. 

= Progress =
As of today, AllEyes components ('ae' daemon, aeProxy, aeManager(Android App), monitors) are prototyped, integrated and tested on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin release).

We completed one cycle of static and runtime analysis of the code.

Entire project history is documented in the project-wiki and in issues section.

We performed integration testing of all the components during which more than 300,000 events generated by the monitors were processed by aeProxy and aeManager Android Application. 


= Limitations =
Open Sourced AllEyes has not been tested on embedded platform.
