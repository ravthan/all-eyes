= Goals =
Perfect security is a myth. Most unbreakable security of today, ages to vulnerability over time. Hence taking quick action after a security breach is critical. Having a security layer along defensive lines, i.e. doing passive/active monitoring of critical components and taking actions based on configurable thresholds provides such a mitigation, against a possible security breach. All-Eyes is such a framework with a potpourri of tools (monitors) useful for defenders, attackers and security professionals.

The goal of All-Eyes project is to ensure the scalability from small embedded systems to large scale servers.

For the NYU-POLY Application Security class project, we prototyped the concept on Ubuntu.
