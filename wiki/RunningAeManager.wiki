= Configuring the Android VM for Local Testing =
  # In order to connect to the AE Proxy in the development environment one has to create a static IP address on the Android VM for *_alleyes.poly.edu_* domain.
  # Start a *_terminal_* on the Linux development environment
  # Run *_ifconfig_* to get the IP address of the Linux host running the aeProxy. These instructions will refer to this IP address as AE_PROXY_IP
  # Start a terminal session on the running android VM with the command: *_adb shell_*
  # Become super-user with the command *_su_*
  # Make the filesystem writable with the command: *_mount –o rw,remount –t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system_*
  # Invoke the command: *_cd  /system/etc_*
  # Create a hosts entry in the hosts file with the command replacing AE_PROXY_IP with the IP address found in step 3 above: *_echo AE_PROXY_IP alleyes.poly.edu  >> hosts_*
  # Type *_exit_* twice to exit the adb shell
