#summary How to setup the Android development environment
= Android Development Environment Setup =

*NOTE1:*  Developers must use the eclipse version mentioned below.  Please do not use the eclipse installed using "Ubuntu Software Center".  We used "Juno Service Release 1" versin of Eclipse Java EE IDE for our development.

*NOTE2:*  Building and bringing up Android aeManager on a Ubuntu Virtual Machine could be challenging.  During the development, we had better luck developing and running Android aeManager application on Ubuntu directly running on X86 hardware.

To setup the android development environment you need to:

==Download and install the Android SDK==
  # sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jdk icedtea6-plugin
  # wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r20-linux.tgz
  # tar -xvzf android-sdk_r20-linux.tgz

==Update the Android SDK==
  # cd ~/android-sdk-linux/tools
  # ./android
  # Install any Android updates for Android 4.1 (if there are any available)
  # After it finished close the Android SDK Manager then restart it
  # Install any Android updates that might have been missed  

==Setup your environment==
  # Edit the .bashrc script in your home directory
  # Add the following: export PATH=${PATH}:~/android-sdk-linux/tools
  # Add the following: export PATH=${PATH}:~/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
