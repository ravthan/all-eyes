#summary How to setup chroot and apparmor the 'ae' daemon

There is the 'ae' daemon installation script, named *_install_chroot.sh_*. This script will create the chroot environment, install the ubuntu OS in the chroot. Then, it installs the 'ae' package and write the 'ae' daemon `AppArmor profile` to proper place and reload the apparmor.

This installation script is part of the tar file named *_ae-daemon.tgz_*. 

= What does the install_chroot.sh do =
   # Installs the needed packages
        * dchroot
        * debootstrap
   # Creates the chroot directory
        * /ae/jail
   # Edit the chroot configuration file /etc/schroot/schroot.conf
        * [precise]
        * description=Precise Gangolin
        * location=/ae/jail
        * priority=3
        * users=ae
        * groups=ae
        * root-groups=root
   # Install the ubuntu OS in the chroot jail
   # Create the 'ae' package config file directory
        * /etc/ae/certs
        * /etc/ae/exports
   # Cross mount the following directories to chroot jail as read only
        * /proc
        * /dev/pts
        * /etc/ae/exports
   # Copy the 'ae' package to the proper directories
        * /usr/local/bin will save the 'ae' daemon 
        * /ae/jail/bin will save the monitor files
        * /etc/ae/certs will save the 'ae' daemon certificates
        * /etc/ae/exports will save the monitor configuration files
   # Copy the 'ae' `AppArmor profile`. This is part of the 'ae' package
        * Copy file *_usr.local.bin.ae_* to directory *_/etc/apparmor.d/_*
   # Then, drop the user to chroot jail as root, and install the necessary packages on top of the OS. This includes
        * vim
        * net_tools
        * openssl
   # Last step is to do ulimit inside the chroot jail. Below is the table of the tunable parameters picked.
|| -c 0 || No core file ||
|| -u 1000 || maximum children that this shell can spawn ||
|| -e 0 || Set the maximum "nice" priority ||
|| -r 0 || Set the real-time priority ||
|| -d 524288 || Limit the datasegment to half a gig ||
|| -i 100 || Limit the filesize written to to 10 Mb ||
|| -n 50 || Set number of open file descriptors ||
|| -q 10240 || Set the message queue size ||
|| -x 20 || Limit the virtual memory available to shell and the programs exec'ed from the shell to 20G ||
|| -v 2097152 || No file locking ||
