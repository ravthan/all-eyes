#summary How to setup chroot and apparmor the 'ae' daemon

There is the 'ae' daemon installation script, named *_install_chroot.sh_*. This script will create the chroot environment, install the ubuntu OS in the chroot. Then, it installs the 'ae' package and write a AppArmor profile for the 'ae' daemon.

This installation script is part of the tar file named *_ae-daemon.tgz_*.

   # Installs the needed packages
