#Code Analysis and Fuzzing tools

= llvm for Ubuntu =

Download link is: http://llvm.org/releases/download.html.
Also one can install by typing "sudo apt-get install clang"
Another useful command is "scan-build make" (http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html)

Note that GCC environmental variable in src/ae/daemon/Makefile.include should be set to /usr/bin/clang and run scan-build with the command line "scan-build -V --use-cc=/usr/bin/clang  make" in the src/ae/daemon directory to make just the daemon.  Using this static analysis tool found a few bugs in the source code.
